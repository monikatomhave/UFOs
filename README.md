UFO signtings Website

Overview:
    The purpose of this assignment was to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored in a JavaScript array.  The user will have the ability to filter the data based on certain criteria and create a subset table all on a website created using an HTML file along with a JavaScript file. 

Results:
    "How to perform the search":  The user visits the website, which upon opening, the entire database table loads as well as different search text boxes.  The user can input any combination of a date, city, state, country or shape of the sighting.  Multiple boxes can have an entry and the table will filter down upon each new criteria entered.  The user hits enter and the table displayed will be a subset of data.  For example, the user could enter "tx" for the state and get all sightings in the state of Texas.  They could then search for a city listed in that list, for example "fort worth" and it will then display only the city and state that match.   

Summary:
    One drawback of this website is the data is only for a few weeks in the month of January in 2010.  The website would be utilized more with a larger dataset to pull from.

    Two recommendations for further development:
     One update of the website would be a "reset" button to just start the search over without having to refresh the whole page.  This upgrade is something that is done in this particular example.  It was not part of the assignment, but I thought it would benificial.

     A second upgrade would maybe to have a one step back of my search button.  Where the user could just go back one step, so if they searched by state first and it pulled up 10 entries, but then they searched by city and got two results, maybe they would want to go back and see just that state again so just go one search back.  Or if they wanted a particular date and then state, but then just for that date, see each state seperately, they could go one back and then enter a different state without having to refresh or reset and enter the date and state each time.
